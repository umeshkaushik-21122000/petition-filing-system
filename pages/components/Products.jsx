    description:"To: State Government, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Railways, Department of Posts and Survey of India. On Tuesday, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde after taking over the Shiv Sena passed a resolution to rename the iconic Churchgate station as Chintamanrao Deshmukh station. This Station was one of the three main gates to the Fort, the Gate that afforded entry to St Thomas' Church and thus called Church Gate, Churchgate station was opened on 10th January 1870. We, the citizens of Mumbai, are writing to express our strong opposition to the proposed name change of Churchgate station to Chintamanrao Deshmukh station.  Churchgate station is an iconic landmark in Mumbai, which has been an integral part of the city's history and culture for over 150 years. The station was named after the Churchgate street on which it is located, and it holds a special place in the hearts of Mumbaikars as it is the last or first stop of the Western Railways."

    description:"To Zomato,We, the undersigned, urge you to reduce the high commission charges for food delivery from our restaurants. The current commission rates of 24-30% are too high, especially for businesses operating in tier 3 cities like ours. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to maintain profitability while also providing affordable and quality food to our customers.We also urge you to stop charging restaurant owners if they cannot fulfil orders due to reasons beyond their control, such as unavailability of ingredients, staff shortage, or delivery issues. This penalty charge is unreasonable and can cause further financial strain on small and medium-sized restaurants."
